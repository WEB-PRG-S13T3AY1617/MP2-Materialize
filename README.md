### New Beginnings Marketplace using Django
This is a simple web application designed to be used for posting and viewing items posted in the server. This web application has user features like a sign in and a sign up feature. Only logged in users can post an item. Each user has their own user profile which displays their name, degree/office, and their latest posts. This web application is created with the help of Bootstrap and Django. It also has a search function which searches for tags to easily sift through posts.
